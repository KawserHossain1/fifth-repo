        <p>The distance between Khagrachari and Sajek is about 70 km. You can visit Sajek Valley by reserving a Jeep Gari/Chander Gari from Khagrachari. It will cost you BDT 8000 to 10000 with the return fare. It is perfect for 12 to 15 people. But if you are in a small group, then join with another group to reduce the cost. If it is not possible to find any other group, then you can take CNG. It will cost you BDT from 4000 to 5000. However, it is better not to travel by CNG as the road is very wavy.
    
            Besides, if you are alone or only 2-3, then many groups are available from the Khagrachari Shapla Chattor, where you can talk to other groups or share your incidents with the Zip Association office. They will manage another group for you.
            
            Apart from you can visit Sajek by going from Khagrachari to Dighinala first. It is 23km from Khagrachari to Dighinala. It takes BDT 45 on the bus and BDT 100 per person on a motorcycle. You can also reserve a motorcycle to travel to Sajek. Before hiring any car/bike, discuss in details about what would you do and what to look.</p></div>
